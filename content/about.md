Hello, I'm an engineer who loves designing solutions involving distributed systems.
My professional interests revolve around the JVM, concurrency, and statically typed programming languages. 
Work has taken me across 4 continents, and spans over a decade, by now.

I have a mild obession with good coffee, and really good wine. I am a soccer fan, but cricket shall always remain my first love.

This is a place where I share my musings on software, philosophy, and the things in between.
