### The future looks promising
Java 14 proposals have got me excited. There seems to be a clear interest in making certain concepts from the functional paradigm mainstream. Few specific ones that are top of mind for me are listed:
* [JEP 360: Sealed Types (Preview)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/384)
* [JEP 384: Records (Second Preview)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/384)
* [JEP 375: Pattern Matching for instanceof (Second Preview)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/361)
* [JEP 361: Switch Expressions (Standard)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/361)

(*While I haven't taken the time to describe what each of these imply, reading the abstract should provide an idea. 
I might update this post to include examples, at some point.*)

### Background
My interest in serious programming dates back to the summer of 2003, in middle school, during a hot Indian summer.

For some reason, the language my teacher decided to introduce me to was Java, not C or BASIC, as was common back then.
There have been fewer moments as joyful as running javac HelloWorld.java one evening and seeing it compile successfully.\
(*I hadn't used fancy IDEs yet, so `public static void main(String[] args)` had to be painstakingly typed out, instead of a `psvm`*)

In late 2013, I was introduced to Scala. By 2016, it had fundamentally influenced my approach to programming, with an **emphasis** on pure functional paradigm.
Writing custom ADTs to model domain entities, leaning on pattern matching heavily as a first class construct, and more than anything else being able to get back to reasoning about computation with a familiar math concept - application of functions to state. (I'm going to stay away from the debate of imperative vs functional, or use the m word).

The point being this brought back the joy that had somewhat been diluted over the years, and felt similar to that summer of 2003.

Professionally, I've preferred writing and operating systems on the JVM, for a decade now.

However, coming back to Java around 2017, after having been immersed in the world of Scala for ~3 years felt limiting. It seemed the spark had gone missing.
While I've consciously stayed away from language wars, this post is to share the hope that's been rekindled recently, and hopefully motivate beginners and seasoned practitioners to feel that joy I relate to.\

For now, I feel a light sense of joy and hope, that kind you feel when being reunited with your first love.
