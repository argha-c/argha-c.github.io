<p>Java 14 proposals have got me excited. There seems to be a clear interest in making certain concepts from the functional paradigm mainstream. Few specific ones that are top of mind for me are listed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/384">JEP 360: Sealed Types (Preview)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/384">JEP 384: Records (Second Preview)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/361">JEP 375: Pattern Matching for instanceof (Second Preview)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/361">JEP 361: Switch Expressions (Standard)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>(<em>While I haven&rsquo;t taken the time to describe what each of these imply, reading the abstract should provide an idea.
I might update this post to include examples, at some point.</em>)</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>My interest in serious programming dates back to the summer of 2003, in middle school, during a hot Indian summer.</p>
<p>For some reason, the language my teacher decided to introduce me to was Java, not C or BASIC, as was common back then.</p>
<p>There have been fewer moments as joyful as running javac HelloWorld.java one evening and seeing it compile successfully.
(I hadn&rsquo;t used fancy IDEs yet, so <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code> had to be painstakingly typed out, instead of a <code>psvm</code>)</p>
<h3 id="journey">Journey</h3>
<p>In late 2013, I was introduced to Scala. By 2016, it had fundamentally influenced my approach to programming, with an <strong>emphasis</strong> on pure functional paradigm.</p>
<p>Writing custom ADTs to model domain entities, leaning on pattern matching heavily as a first class construct, and more than anything else being able to get back to reasoning about computation with a familiar math concept - application of functions to state. (I&rsquo;m going to stay away from the debate of imperative vs functional, or use the m word).</p>
<p>The point being this brought back the joy that had somewhat been diluted over the years, and felt similar to that summer of 2003.</p>
<p>Professionally, I&rsquo;ve preferred writing and operating systems on the JVM, for a decade now.</p>
<p>However, coming back to Java around 2017, after having been immersed in the world of Scala for ~3 years felt limiting. It seemed the spark had gone missing.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve consciously stayed away from language wars, this post is to share the hope that&rsquo;s been rekindled recently, and hopefully motivate beginners and seasoned practitioners to feel that joy I relate to.</p>
<p>For now, I feel a light sense of joy and hope; the kind you feel when being reunited with your first love.</p>
