I am an engineer who loves designing solutions involving distributed systems, for web scale. My professional interests revolve around concurrency, the JVM, and strongly typed programming languages running on it. My work has taken me across 4 continents, and spans more than a decade, by now.
Personally, I have a mild obession with good coffee, and really good wine. I am a soccer fan, but cricket shall always remain my first love." />
